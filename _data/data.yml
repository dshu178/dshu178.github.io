          Partner with Qualcomm’s different technology teams to design innovative digital enhancements to wireless products.
            ●	Bringing up 11be/WiFi7 waveforms from Matlab/SystemVue simulation to Lab bench validation for compensating various RF impairments.
            ●	Researching PA drooping compensation methods from both silicon process and system baseband. Created a statistic model in MATLAB for estimating the EVM distributions with open loop DPD and improving baseband drooping compensation method based on the PA’s physical thermal nature.
          
          Working on 4 categories of battery driven mobile system-level low power design. Owner of power, thermal, throughput, latency KPIs over process, voltage, and temperature. 
            ●	Lower voltage, current, leakage and frequency.
            ●	Shorten the SoC circuit activity time such as power collapse, clock gate etc.
            ●	Balance trade-offs on RF coverage, throughput, and power per Day-of-Use cases.
            ●	Use CSMA/CA based approach to lower the system wake-up frequency.
          Invented mobile SoC dynamic voltage control algorithm for power saving and throughput improvement based on multivariate machine learning models.
            ●	Design of Experiments (DOE) approach from large lab datasets.
            ●	Use multivariate machine learning models to calculate the polynomial functions SoC Vmin vs. SoC Process, Tj, and Throughput.
            ●	Model results have been validated on three generations of SoC designs.
          Maintaining the pace of per year learning/creating 2 new things in addition to daily work.
            ●	2023, Built MSSQL database and implemented off-the-shelf DPD solution. 
            ●	2022, Invented sinewave drooping characterization method and enabled SystemVue simulation platform for complex RF co-exist simulation.
